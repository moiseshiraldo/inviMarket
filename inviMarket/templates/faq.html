        InviMarket is a website where you can share and get invites
        or referral links to other sites, as well as get information
        relative to the invite/referral system of those sites.

        {% blocktrans %}
        InviMarket is not a website where you can sell or buy invites.
        The use of a market terminology is a mere gamification to
        encourage users to share invites, referral links and
        information.

        Search sites by using the search form in the top menu or the
        the 'Sites' page, and request/offer invites or referral links to
        the ones your interested in. In the 'Trading' page you can find
        users that match up with your requests/offers and propose
        trades to them.

        You can search sites, view their information and get random
        referral links without an account. You need to register to trade
        invites and edit sites information.

        {% blocktrans %}
        It means the site is protected, so you can't view an invite
        request/offer to that site unless the user is your friend. The
        working of many sites depends on the correct use of the invites
        system, and though the ultimate responsibility lays on the user,
        we don't want to be an easy tool to break other sites rules.

      <h4 class="faq-header">{% trans "Can other users view my email address?" %}</h4>
      <p class="faqtext">
        {% blocktrans %}No, the invites are sended to an email addres
        at the inviMarket domain, then forwarded to your email address. All the
        emails coming from a domain not listed in our sites database ('domain'
        on the site information page) will be rejected.

        {% blocktrans %}
        We keep a temporary copy of the emails. If the user haven't sent
        the invites within one week since the trade proposal was
        accepted, you can make a complaint on the trade details page
        and the user will receive a warning. Every warning will
        decrease the user rating, and after three warnings the account
        will be banned.

        No, the username cannot be edited. You can create a new
        account, but can't migrate trades, rating and editions.
